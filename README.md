# SI1336 Simulation and Modeling

This is the collection of the assignments given for the course Simulation and Modeling (SI1336), as well as my solutions for each one.

Every project has one folder, which contains the lecture notes, the assignment, the given code template files, my report (both in LaTeX form including the source images, and a final PDF version) as well as my modified versions of the templates and my own code where there was no template given.
