# Grade: A

## Project formulation

Short introduction. It would have been nice to spend a few more sentences on explaining how random walks model polymers, rather than referring back to the weekly project.

## Discretization

All correct, including correct angle distribution.

## Execution

All correct.

## Analysis

Nice to compare with a 2D random walk. If you know how diffusion works and how this is similar to random walks, it would come as no surprise that the dimensionality has no effect on the RMS distance. But if you don't know this, it is indeed surprising. Analysis of all important aspects, including fluctuations, error and success rates. It would have been nice to fit exponents, but the results are clear form the plots.

## Report

Well organized, clearly written report. Clear plots that are mostly well labeled, but it would have been better to put the type of walk in the title or caption.
