# 4. Electrostatics

Lecture notes (clarified boundary conditions in assignments, adding missing words in 4.1 a) ):

[Electrostatics-2.pdf](Electrostatics-2.pdf)

Assignments only (now really corrected, one assignment was from last year; the lecture notes had correct assignments, adding missing words in 4.1 a) ):

[Assignments4-4.pdf](Assignments4-4.pdf)

Simple (non object-oriented) template for relaxation (now actually the template without Poisson term that shouldn't be there):

[elec_template-1.py](templates/elec_template-1.py)

Note: you can use matplotlib.pyplot.contour or matplotlib.pyplot.contourf to draw the equipotential surfaces.
